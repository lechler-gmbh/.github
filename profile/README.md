# Welcome to Lechler

**Europe's no. 1 in spray technology**

When it comes to precision nozzles and nozzle systems, everything speaks for Lechler. With such a broad and considerable understanding of the industry and with over 140 years of development experience, we understand spray technology like no one else. And with first-class quality and a close customer relationship, we also implement them.

Liquids. Shapes. For progress.

Continuous improvement corresponds to our philosophy. Right from the early days we have been developing our products and markets – and we think in the long term. As a family-owned company, we are convinced that if products, customer relationships and employee loyalty continue in the long run, everyone benefits.

»Longevity and quality are always good business. Who only lives as a result of wear, wears down their customers. We prefer to convince through performance, know-how and a long-term partnership.«
Prof. Walter H. Lechler (1942 – 2018)
